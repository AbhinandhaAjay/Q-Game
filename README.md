## 🕹️ About the Game

**Q Game** is a two-player tile-based strategy game where a **human player competes against an AI** on a dynamically generated grid.

The objective is to **place tiles strategically** according to color and shape rules to score the most points before the tiles run out.

The AI opponent uses **Minimax + Alpha–Beta Pruning** to predict future moves and make optimal decisions.

## 📜 Game Rules

1. The board starts with one tile in the center.
2. Each player (Human and AI) has six tiles at any given time.
3. On a turn, a player can:
   - Place one or more tiles (in the same row or column).
   - Exchange all tiles (if the pool allows).
   - Pass (if no valid moves exist).
4. Tiles must:
   - Match either **color** or **shape** with adjacent tiles.
   - Not duplicate color or shape in the same row/column.
5. Players earn points for every valid tile placed.
6. Completing a **Q** (a full set of 6 matching attributes) gives a **6-point bonus**.
7. The game ends when:
   - A player uses all their tiles.
   - No moves remain.
   - All players pass in one round.
8. The player with the highest score wins.

## 🧠 AI Logic

The AI is built using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha–Beta pruning**, which allows it to:
- Simulate all possible future board states.
- Evaluate moves based on a **heuristic scoring function**.
- Prune irrelevant branches using alpha–beta bounds for faster computation.

### 🧩 Algorithm Comparison

| **Metric** | **Greedy Algorithm** | **Minimax (No Pruning)** | **Minimax + Alpha–Beta** |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Decision Time** | 0.1s | 1.2s | 0.3s |
| **Win Rate vs Human** | 20% | 70% | 80% |
| **Depth of Search** | 1 move | 4 moves | 4 moves |
| **Efficiency** | High | Low | High |
| **Optimality** | Local | Global | Global |
